**University Course Registration System**

This project implements a University Course Registration System using Python. It provides a complete workflow for managing students, lecturers, courses, and performance evaluation. The project includes both the original implementation and a refactored version with improved maintainability, design quality, and reduced complexity.

📌 **Key Features**
**1. Student Management**

Register new students

Enroll students into courses

Track grades and attendance

**2. Course Management**

Create and manage courses

Enroll students into courses

Assign lecturers to specific courses

**3. Lecturer Management**

Add lecturers

Assign courses

Submit student grades

**4. Performance Evaluation**

Calculate student GPA

Compute attendance rates

Generate detailed performance reports

**5. Reporting**

Student performance summaries

Lecturer-course assignments

Course enrollment overviews

Full system-wide report generation

📁 **Project Structure**
File	Description
University_Course_Registration_System.py	Original implementation
University_Course_Registration_System_Refactored.py	Refactored version with improved design, cohesion, and reduced coupling
README.md	Project documentation
🚀 **How to Run the Project**

Clone or download this repository.

Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.

Run the original system:

python University_Course_Registration_System.py


Run the refactored system:

python University_Course_Registration_System_Refactored.py

🔧** Improvements in the Refactored Version**

✔ Reduced cyclomatic complexity in performance calculations

✔ Improved cohesion through helper methods for GPA and attendance

✔ Lower coupling between Student, Course, and Lecturer classes

✔ Clearer class responsibilities and better data encapsulation

✔ More maintainable, extendable, and testable codebase
